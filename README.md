Requirements: Needs a console to show the text/results, and IDE using Python 3 or the Python 3 IDLE.
Recommendations: use Repl.it or some other IDE (Pycharm, Visual Studio, etc.) to run the files or the Python 3 IDLE to run it. 
You can find the Python 3 IDLE online and install it from there. There is also an Object Oriented Programming version of this. Do not use the OOP as a template for how to use OOP as this is most likely the incorrect way to do so. The syntax for OOP is of course correct and I did it to learn more about it.
